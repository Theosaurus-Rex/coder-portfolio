        <!--Biography-->
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Theo! I'm currently studying to become a full-stack developer at Coder Academy Australia.
            I was drawn to programming because I crave new challenges and my ideal career is one where I am always learning something new.
            I love web design in particular as it allows me to combine my creative background with critical thinking and problem solving.
            I enjoy creating websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly accessible. <br>

            When I'm not studying, I enjoy creating art pieces as a practicing artist. 
            I'm currently working toward my first solo exhibition, which will be opening in April 2021.
            I also enjoy playing video games, reading, watching horror movies, and drinking coffee.
        </p>
        <!--Work History-->
        <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
        <h3>Australian Geographic, 2018-2020</h3>
        <p>During my time at Australian Geographic, I built a strong foundation of interpersonal skills by dealing with highly specialised customer requests and problems.
            This position required specialised knowledge of products used for STEM education, as well as scientific tools such as microscopes and telescopes.
            I was also responsible for training junior staff members who joined us during the holiday periods.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cash Handling and Admin Duties</li>
            <li>Customer Service and Product Assistance</li>
            <li>Technical Knowledge</li>
            <li>Visual Merchandising and OHS Enforcement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Petstock, 2015-2017</h3>
        <p>My time at Petstock saw me undertaking a variety of duties encompassing both animal and customer needs. 
            I was equally resposible for attending to customers and assisting with their needs as I was for properly taking care of various species of small animals, including birds, fish, reptiles, insects, rabbits and guinea pigs.
            I was also responsible for the appearance of the store, as well as ensuring all live stock arrived in healthy condition.
            I made it my personal mission to make sure that all customers purchasing animals were properly aware of how to best care for their new pets to avoid animals going to unsuitable homes.
        </p>
